It is different from tort since it generally refers to a negligent act or omission which causes damage to another person, giving rise to obligation to pay for damages. [Article 2176]",
                              "On the other hand, tort is an Anglo-American concept which refers not only to a negligent act but also to intentional criminal acts. Thus, tort is a broader concept than quasi-delict.",

With this declaration of the Court, it is understood that our concept of quasi-delict has broadened and is not only confined with purely negligent acts. In fact, in Lipata v. People of the Philippines [G.R. No. 200302, April 20, 2016], the High Court emphasized that a civil suit for quasi-delict arising from murder maybe instituted separately by the heirs of the victim.",
